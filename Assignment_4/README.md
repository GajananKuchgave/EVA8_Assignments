# Assignment 4

## new target is:
    99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)
    Less than or equal to 15 Epochs

# Attempt 1
    Target: 

      Reduced the parameters less than 10000 by changing number of channels as it was the requirement.
      
    Results:

      Parameters: 9900 param
      Best Train Accuracy: 98.88
      Best Test Accuracy: 99.38 (13h Epoch)
      Analysis:
      The model is under-fitting now. This is fine, as we know we have made our train data harder. 
      The test accuracy is good as of now
      
      
# Attempt 2
    Target: 

      Improve the Accuracy more than 99.4 keeping the same parameters by changing Learning rate and/or number of kernels to the GAP
      
    Results:

      Parameters: 9900 param
      Best Train Accuracy: 99.09
      Best Test Accuracy: 99.49 (13h Epoch)
      Analysis:
      The model is consistent now for the last 4 iterations and test accuracy is more than 99.4. 
      This is the best accuracy I could get here
      
 # Attempt 3
    Target: 

      Try by reducing the parameters but keeping 99.4% accuracy 
      
    Results:

      Parameters: 8790 param 
      Best Train Accuracy: 99.05
      Best Test Accuracy: 99.42 (10th Epoch)
      Analysis:
      Able to reduce the parameters bit. Model did crossd the 99.4 but at the end it stuck at 99.39 for last epoch. 
      The parameter reduction and improvement in accuracy can be achieved next time but its good learning as of now
